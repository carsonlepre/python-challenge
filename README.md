Week Three Bootcamp Homework Repo

README file accompanying my late homework:

As the instructors requested, I’m noting when my work is the result of collaborative efforts. Both the PyBank and PyPoll assignments were completed with assistance from my study group. To make it clear that I am learning the material, I’ve changed things (more than just variable names!), and taken different approaches to solving issues in both assignments. I’ve left plenty of comments so that it will be clear to the instructor team that I understand what I’m turning in. 

There were libraries and methods that I did not know about, and didn’t learn about in class that were used in these assignments. Sometimes seeing other people’s work helps a lot to make things clear. It’s much more constructive for me, I feel, to sometimes reverse engineer a piece of working software, rather than to bash my head against a piece of code that I simply can’t get to work. (I did plenty of solo head bashing as well.)

As I worked on the assignments I switched between my desktop and my laptop machines, and I used github to update my work so I’d get a decent amount of practice with version control, especially including terminal commands.


Thanks!
